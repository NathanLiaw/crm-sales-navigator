# Background
The project focuses on enhancing the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with a specific emphasis on Sales Management. Our primary objective is to scrabble into the existing application system architecture to upgrade the overall User Experience (UX) for the existing web application. The initiative includes examining the current system to comprehend and refine the architecture. The project extends beyond web enhancement, containing the development of a mobile app version and requires a deep understanding of the existing system's architecture. Key enhancements involve the integration of interactive dashboards with real-time analytics for business performance monitoring, personalized customer service features, and the assurance of a user-friendly interface across various devices.
